- I got confused by the instructions that say that the program can be run by typing "run CoinMachine 400 215" in the Interactions Pane, since this command is deprecated.
It took me a while to figure out why my code was not running on the console.

- I did not include comments inside the main method because it would not be good practice in this case since the code - with the variable names - is self explanatory.
